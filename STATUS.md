# OS Components – Exploration Status

This repository is a systems exploration lab.
Folders are NOT commitments.

## Anchor (stable, rarely touched)

01_boot

## Explore (active experiments)

03_physmem
04_paging

## Parked (intentionally unfinished)

Rule:
If a component is parked, it is allowed to be incomplete forever.
